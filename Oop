Inheritance:
        Inheritance is system in which an object or class acquires all the properties of a parent object.
        The advantage of inheritance is that you can reuse methods without having to duplicate the whole class.
        The disadvantage of inheritance is that the parent and child classes cannot be used seperately

Polymorphism:
        Polymorphism is a way we can modify old methods from the inherited parent class in the newer child class
        Advantage:
                    Suppose you have multiple child classes under a parent class and you want to modify a specific child class
                    If you make changes to the parent object every child object will change
                    However with polymorphism you can use the same name of the method but modify or make the child object unique
        Disadvantage:
                    Run time polymorphism has performance issues as the machine needs to decide whether it should use the old
                    or new method
                    
Encapsulation:
        Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping variables and code acting on the methods together as a single unit.
        This is done by providing setters or getters in the code.
        Advantage: With the getter and setter codes it is easier for an outside class to access data from a class
